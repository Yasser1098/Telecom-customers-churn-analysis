# Telecom-customers-churn-analysis
Analysing customer data for a telecommunication company by applying a single and multiple linear regression to get a better idea about what is the main reasons for customers churn
# Starting with validating the data

In the beginning, i have gone through the data to make sure that i have a clean and valid data to work with, and i found some issues with the validity and consistency of the data.
Some of these issues are duplicated rows, null values in many of the columns and some inconsistency in the data.
# Insights

After validating the data, i started generating insights by exploring the data through applying some pivoting and graphical representation to understand customer behaviour and get an overview about the data.
# Results

The insights that i get gave me a better understanding that helped me to recognize which factors may be affecting the churn score, however that is not enough so in the last step i applied regression analysis to identify which factors impact the churn score
# Regression Analysis

At first, i split my data into categorical and numerical then i applied encoding techniques like lable encoding and one hot encoding to the categorical data for better results in the regression analysis as the model only deal with numbers.
# In the end

you can find three files in this repo: 1. Data Validation and cleaning report(a pdf file that includes every step i have made through out the project with justification)
2. Ahmed Yasser (regression) (Excel file that includes the regression analysis that i have done on the data)
3. Tele cust churn pivot - Dashboard Ahmed Yasser (Excel file that includes a dashboard that gives an overview about the customers and the problem of churn)
